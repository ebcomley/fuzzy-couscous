                <p>Hi there, I'm Edward. I work as a Senior Designer in IT Services, providing support for design to user-focused website projects across the University.<br><br>I love all things web and tech, and I'm always consuming new information in that space. When I'm not working or spending time with my family (husband/dad here), I enjoy coffee, food and positive enthusiasm!<br><br>I also try to manage my brain plasticity through mindfulness and exercise - it's been great for me so far!<br><br>One thing I'm not keen on is sand - it gets everywhere!</p>
